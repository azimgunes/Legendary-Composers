# **About Legendary Composers**

The Legendary Composers application is a project that contains concise biographies of composers with great international and historical significance, presents one of their famous compositions, and provides a link to the artist's Spotify profile from the application.

One of the main goals of the Legendary Composers project is to understand the principles of using structures such as TableView and TableViewCell, and to gain experience by putting them into practice. Another goal is to understand the logic of implementing the MVVM architecture within the project and to make this architecture applicable in projects. The UI part of the project has been developed without using storyboards. This project is also practical in terms of algorithmic logic and the use of MVVM architecture.
